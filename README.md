# Automative-Morrocan-Arabic-Speech-Command-Datset
In this repository, you will find the dataset used for building the first automotive speech recognition system in the Arabic dialect, specifically the Moroccan dialect. The dataset includes 20 commonly used in-car commands, carefully selected to aid Arabic drivers in making their driving experience comfortable and safe by reducing the distraction ratio.

The dataset used in this research is currently in use and not publicly available. 
However, authors interested in utilizing this dataset or our codes for research purposes are welcome to do so.
